# Expo DocumentPicker Android URI Undefined Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's DocumentPicker API on Android where the selected file URI is sometimes returned as `undefined`.  This issue causes unpredictable application behavior when attempting to process the selected file.

## Bug Description

When using the `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` method on Android, the returned `uri` property is occasionally `undefined`, even if the user successfully selects a file. This inconsistency leads to crashes or errors when the application attempts to access the file.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Run the provided `bug.js` example on an Android device or emulator.
2. Select a file using the DocumentPicker.
3. Observe that the URI is sometimes logged as `undefined`.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a workaround to handle this undefined behavior more gracefully. The fix involves adding a check to handle cases where the `uri` property might be missing, preventing crashes and enhancing the user experience.   This is not a perfect solution, as it relies on fallback mechanisms. A more robust fix would require addressing the root cause within the Expo DocumentPicker implementation.
